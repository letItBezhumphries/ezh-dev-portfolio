          <p>
            For the past 10 years, I followed my passion for creative problem
            solving as a professional film, stage, and Shakespearean actor.
            Figuring out how to bring all of myself to a character has now, over
            the past few years, morphed into an enjoyment of problem solving in
            the realm of software engineering and web development. I am
            currently looking for a full time software engineering position in
            the greater Los Angeles area.
