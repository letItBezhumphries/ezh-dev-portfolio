  "In 2019 upon graduating from Hack Reactor's software engineering immersive, I have continued building upon my experience developing and designing software for the web, from simple landing pages to Full Stack web applications. I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides intuitive and clean user experiences.",
  "I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the best in me.",
  'Before changing careers, I followed my passion for creative problem solving as a professional film, stage, and Shakespearean actor. Figuring out how to bring all of myself to a character has now, over the past few years, morphed into an enjoyment of problem solving in the realm of software engineering and web development.',

For static sites, I love using Gatsby for creating blazing fast, SEO-driven headless frontend user interfaces.");
